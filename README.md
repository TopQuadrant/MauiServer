# Maui Server: A topic indexing server based on Maui

This is Maui Server, an HTTP wrapper around the [Maui Topic Indexer](https://github.com/zelandiya/maui).

Maui Server provides a topic indexing service. It automatically determines the main topics of a text, with candidate topics coming from a [SKOS](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/) vocabulary. It requires training data—documents with previously assigned topics—to work. Maui Server is a Java web application and provides RESTful, JSON-based APIs (see [API documentation](https://github.com/TopQuadrant/MauiServer/blob/master/API.md)).

## Download and Installation

**Requirements:** Maui Server requires a Java Servlet Container such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty to run. The container must support at least Servlet Spec 6.0 or Jakarta EE 10.

**Download:** Maui Server is distributed as a war file (`mauiserver-X.Y.Z.war`). It can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/TopQuadrant/MauiServer/releases). The very latest pre-release version can also be built from the source repository, see below.

**Installation:** To install and run it, deploy the war file into the servlet container (usually by copying it into the container's `webapps` directory, maybe after renaming it).

## Configuring the data directory

Maui Server needs a **data directory** on the file system where it keeps its data. This directory is established in the following way:

1. If the Java **system property** `MauiServer.dataDir` is set, use its value. (This can be set on the Java command line via `-DMauiServer.dataDir=...`)
2. Otherwise, if the OS **environment variable** `MAUI_SERVER_DATA_DIR` is set, use its value. (How to set this depends on the operating system.)
3. Otherwise, use a subdirectory `data` in the **current directory**, from where Maui Server was started.

The directory must already exist, otherwise initialisation will fail.

## Configuring the default language

By default, Maui Server assumes that vocabulary and content are in English. The global language can be set using the Java **system property** `MauiServer.defaultLang`, or the OS **environment variable** `MAUI_SERVER_DEFAULT_LANG`. Supported values are `en`, (English), `fr` (French), `es` (Spanish) and `de` (German). The default language can be overridden on a per-tagger basis using the `lang` key in the configuration.

## Setting up authentication

A simple recipe for securing Maui Server behind a username/password:

1. Uncomment the `<security-constraint>`/`<login-config>` sections in `web.xml`
2. Add a user with role `maui-server` to your servlet container configuration; for Tomcat, this could mean adding to `/conf/tomcat-users.xml`:

   ```
   <role rolename="maui-server"/>
   <user username="admin" password="password" roles="maui-server"/>
   ```

## API documentation

See [API.md](https://github.com/TopQuadrant/MauiServer/blob/master/API.md).

## Building and Running from Source

The project uses Maven for building.

- `mvn package` creates a war file in the `/target` directory, for deployment with a servlet container such as Tomcat or Jetty.
- `mvn jetty:run` runs Maui Server directly, using Jetty. The server will start up at http://localhost:8080/ . This can be convenient for testing. Add `-Djetty.http.port=6666` to run on a different port.

The API root is at `/`. A small demo app is at `/app/` (requires tagger creation and training through the API).
